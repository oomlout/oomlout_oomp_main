# oomlout_oomp_main

# details

This is a repo that is just a readme describing the various parts of oomp (oopen organization method for parts) at their various stages


# possibly useful outputs

* oomlout_oomp_footprint_all_the_kicad_footprints -- this is a kicad.pretty folder containing all the footprints documented in oomlout_oomp_footprint_src ( https://github.com/oomlout/oomlout_oomp_footprint_all_the_kicad_footprints )
* oomlout_oomp_symbol_all_the_kicad_symbols -- this is a set of kicad symbol files containing all the source footprints for oomlout_oomp_symbol_src ( https://github.com/oomlout/oomlout_oomp_symbol_all_the_kicad_symbols )

# oomp parts

These are repos that fall under the oomp parts category. This is about documenting electronic components in a useful way, and generating kicad libraries to make using them useful as well.

## main ones  

* oomlout_oomp_part_src -- this is the source and output for defining various electronic components ( https://github.com/oomlout/oomlout_oomp_part_src )
* oomlout_oomp_part_templates  -- these are symbol and footprint templates for building footprints later

## generated outputs  

* oomlout_oomp_part_kicad_symbols -- the symbols of all the oomp parts ( https://github.com/oomlout/oomlout_oomp_parts_kicad_symbols )
* oomlout_oomp_part_kicad_footprints -- the footprints of all the parts defined in oomp ( https://github.com/oomlout/oomlout_oomp_parts_kicad_footprints )

# oomp footprints

Here are all the repos related to documenting available footprint libraries.

* oomlout_oomp_footprint_src -- the source files and code for loading in known symbols ( https://github.com/oomlout/oomlout_oomp_footprint_src )
* oomlout_oomp_footprint_bot -- the source details are brought in and extra details are added like images and extra data ( https://github.com/oomlout/oomlout_oomp_footprint_bot )
* oomlout_oomp_footprint_doc -- the bot details presented in a slightly more navigatable format - ( https://github.com/oomlout/oomlout_oomp_footprint_doc )

# oomp modules

Here are all the modules made up off oomp_parts to copy and paste into kicad projects

* oomlouoomlout_oomp_modules_src -- all modules are defined and stored

# oomp projects

Here are all the repos related to documenting available projects. These are harvested by using known open hardware designers and looking through their repos. Any repo with a kicad or eagle board file is added and the first discovered board and schematic file are used. This means many projects have the wrong files documented.

* oomlout_oomp_project_src -- the source files and code for loading in known symbols ( https://github.com/oomlout/oomlout_oomp_project_src )
* oomlout_oomp_project_bot -- the source details are brought in and extra details are added like images and extra data ( https://github.com/oomlout/oomlout_oomp_project_bot )

# oomp symbols

Here are all the repos related to documenting available symbol libraries.

* oomlout_oomp_symbol_src -- the source files and code for loading in known symbols ( https://github.com/oomlout/oomlout_oomp_symbol_src )
* oomlout_oomp_symbol_bot -- the source details are brought in and extra details are added like images and extra data ( https://github.com/oomlout/oomlout_oomp_symbol_bot )
* oomlout_oomp_symbol_doc -- the bot details presented in a slightly more navigatable format - ( https://github.com/oomlout/oomlout_oomp_symbol_doc )
